// ── The check registry ──
//
// Single source of truth for what this scanner tests, how each verdict is decided, and why the
// factor matters for generative-engine citation.
//
// Both the scanner and the published methodology checklist read from this file. That is the whole
// point: a checklist maintained by hand is accurate the day it is written and wrong a month later,
// and the gap between what a tool claims to check and what it actually checks is exactly where
// credibility is lost with a client.
//
// Every entry states an explicit rule. GEO is a machine reading a machine, so a verdict should be
// reproducible by anyone holding the same page — "the content should be substantial" is an
// opinion, "under 300 words fails" is a measurement. Where a factor genuinely cannot be settled
// remotely it is marked unverifiable rather than guessed at.
